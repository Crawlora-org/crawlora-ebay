# eBay clients for Crawlora

Official Crawlora client packages for the hosted eBay API. These clients call Crawlora's hosted API; they do not scrape eBay locally. Requests use your Crawlora account and `CRAWLORA_API_KEY`; service usage follows your account billing plan. Crawlora is independent from and not affiliated with or endorsed by eBay or its owners.

Create an account at [crawlora.net](https://crawlora.net/signup?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=platform-clients&utm_content=ebay-repository-signup), open the [Crawlora console](https://crawlora.net/app?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=platform-clients&utm_content=ebay-repository-console) to get an API key, or read the [API documentation](https://crawlora.net/docs?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=platform-clients&utm_content=ebay-repository-api-docs). Keep `CRAWLORA_API_KEY` out of source control.
