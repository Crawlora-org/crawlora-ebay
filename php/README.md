# Crawlora eBay PHP client

This package calls the Crawlora hosted API at `https://api.crawlora.net/api/v1`. It does not call or scrape eBay directly. Requests require a Crawlora API key and use your Crawlora account's service plan.

## Install

```sh
composer require crawlora/ebay
```

Create an account at [crawlora.net](https://crawlora.net/signup?utm_source=packagist&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=platform-clients&utm_content=ebay-php-signup), open the [Crawlora console](https://crawlora.net/app?utm_source=packagist&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=platform-clients&utm_content=ebay-php-console) to get an API key, then set `CRAWLORA_API_KEY` in your environment.

```php
<?php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new Crawlora\Ebay\Client(apiKey: getenv('CRAWLORA_API_KEY'));
$result = $client->request("ebay-item", ['item_id' => 'sample-id']);
print_r($result);
$client->close();
```

The client uses PHP cURL and JSON. Constructor options are `apiKey`, `baseUrl`, and `timeout`. Call the operation-specific method for direct access to each supported operation, or `request($operationId, $params, $responseType)` to dispatch by operation ID. Set `$responseType` to `text` for raw text output such as transcript formats. The package includes 10 API operations.

The complete operation and parameter reference is in the [platform repository](https://github.com/Crawlora-org/crawlora-ebay/blob/main/docs/usage.md).
